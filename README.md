I've been hacking my way through coding for 27+ years--learning by studying the code of others, reading documentation, pouring through stackexchange, and lots of trial and error/experimentation. I learned C+/++ in college and haven't really used it since. Now I develop web-based applications with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. I'm currently learing Python and hope to follow that path into AI/Machine Learning.
